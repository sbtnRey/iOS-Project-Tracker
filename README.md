**I wanted to keep track of each iOS project I've made, so I made this list. The top most posts are the most recently finished apps.**

Who's that Pokemon
------

Wanted to make a simple guessing game based on the pokemon show. Right before commercial breaks the show would show a blacked out image of a pokemon then when the commercial break ended it would go back to the the mystery pokemon and reveal it. I used python to scrape, clean, and modify (create blacked out images) the pokemon images (first 151 pokemon) and scrape the sounds they make.

Random Tao Te Ching
------

Excerpts from the Tao Te Ching are pretty interesting, so I made an app that takes a single paragraph from a random chapter and prints it the screen. Each time the button is pressed a new random paragraph is shown. Python was used to clean, and modify the Tao Te Ching.

Old Piano

Basically a very simple sound generating app with a several keys one can press to generate some lo-fi piano sounds.
